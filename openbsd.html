I decided to install (VirtualBox) OpenBSD and follow the instructions presented during installation.

==========================================================================================

Once system is installed, you should check your mail.
System also warns you of new mail once you log in.
Type 'mail' command.
One of the mails is a short introduction to the system itself which also tells you where to look next.
You can use "mail $NUMBER" to read any of the mails.
The command itself has many options - and I still don't know how to use all of it.
You can use 'x' to save the mail you're currently reading.
It is saved to /var/mail/$USER, defined in /etc/skel/.cshrc.
Command 'mail' also sends old mail to mbox file, located in /home/$USER/mbox.

In that mail, a few useful bits:
- use 'man afterboot'
- man man, man -k
- preconfigured packages (binaries) are available from mirrors
- mirror list is openbsd.org/ftp.html (saved to /etc/installurl)
- packages are installed with pkg_add
- all system conf is in /etc

There was a lot of useful info in man page for afterboot, including help program,
and I will go through it one by one.

==========================================================================================

/etc/installurl

To start from scratch, I checked list of mirrors.
My system didn't have /etc/installurl, so I ran man -k installurl.
I received installurl(5) man page as a result, and went ahead to check it.
It's a short man page, stating that /etc/installurl contains a single line, 
specifiyng mirror server URL. It is created by installer script during installation
and upgrades over HTTP.
I also couldn't run syspatch -- it reported invalid URL in /etc/installurl.
Since it wasn't on the expected location, I ran grep -R on /etc looking for installurl.
It returned the file /etc/changelist.
/etc/changelist turned out to be a list of files checked by security script, not relevant
the reason /etc/installurl was missing.
I went to check on the internet, and found out /etc/installurl is creating when doing netinstall ONLY.
I installed from disk/cdrom, so all the required files were there already, no need to fetch from mirror.
There was no mirror for Croatia, so I went with Cloudflare CDN instead.
To test, I ran pkg_add -v vim, and it worked.

Even though it is logical, perhaps it should be written in introduction in which cases /etc/installurl won't be 
generated, and that it should be done manually if that is the case.

==========================================================================================

Getting a HR keyboard

Can't type pipes like this... :)

On installation, I chose DE layout, written to /etc/kbdtype.

kbd -l didn't show HR layout, so I went to check what are my other options.

Apparently, HR is not supported, or it may be if kernel is patched and recompiled:

Additionally, stuff like this should be supported via X display.
