<b>WPA3</b>
<ul>
  <li>WPA2 was introduced in 2004</li>
  <li>WPA3 is focused on bringing new techniques to bear against the cracks that have begun to show in WPA2</li>
  <li>two additional, separate certification protocols alongside WPA3: Enhanced Open and Easy Connect - not dependent on WPA3</li>
  <li>Simultaneous Authentication of Equals - new method of authenticating a device trying to connect to a network</li>
  <li>192-Bit Security Protocols - WiFi is currently at 128</li>
  <li>Easy Connect - Rather than enter passwords every time you want to add something to your network, 
    devices will have unique QR codes—each device’s code will function as a sort of public key</li>
  <li>Enhanced Open - protection against this sort of passive eavesdropping</li>
</ul>

<b>Formal verification in Networking</b>
<p>Formal verification uses mathematics to verify the correctness of an underlying system in 
  relation to its specification. In networking, this means network personnel can use formal verification 
  to verify if the network is going to behave as intended. With a dynamic map of the entire network, 
  they can evaluate everything that can possibly go wrong and prevent disasters BEFORE they actually happen.</p>
<p>Most networks in use today aren't scalable: most were cobbled together to meet various needs; today, they are messy, 
  Frankenstein-like collections of hardware and software that do not address business objectives such as ensuring 
  compliance or securing data.</p>
<p>What’s more, recent networking technologies such as virtualization, SDN and NFV, which were designed to improve 
  operations and network performance, have made networks even more complex.</p>
<p>Formal verification is connected to a larger methodology called intent-based networking (IBN). 
  Continuously verifying that the network matches the intent of the business is a critical component of any IBN system. 
  If the intent is not being met, the system can take corrective actions automatically, such as adding or removing capacity, 
  or preventing changes from occurring. Although intuitive networks are on the horizon, verification is enabling business today.
  Companies such as Veriflow and Intentionet are using formal verification in their intent-based networking solutions. 
  Cisco Systems also has made product announcements in the area of intent-based networking, and Juniper Networks is 
  now working on intent-based networking technologies.</p>
