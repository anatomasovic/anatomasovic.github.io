<b>FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults</b>
<a href="https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults.txt">Original</b>
<em>Mailer daemon</em>
Sendmail included by default.If you actually run a mail server, there are better options like Postfix or
OpenSMTPD. If you only need to send mail through a third party provider like
Gmail, ssmtp is a another lightweight alternative.
<br>
<em>Firewall</em>
Three included by default: IPFW (native), PF (ported from OpenBSD), and IPFilter
The version of PF included with FreeBSD hasn't
been synced with upstream since 2009.
<br>
<em>NTP</em>
A lot of FreeBSD security advisories have been related to the NTP daemon
included in the base system, known as the "reference implementation."
It's really shitty code, written mainly by time geeks and scientists instead
of people who actually run network-facing services.
<em>Periodic</em>
Many useless things, some even potentially a security risk, will be running
in the background by default. A lot of them are poorly documented or maybe
not documented at all.
I'll only suggest disabling one in particular...

I most certainly don't want pkg (running as root, remember) going out to
the internet every night to fetch a list of vulnerable ports.
