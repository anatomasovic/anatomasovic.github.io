<b>Containers, zones, jails, VMs</b>
<a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/">Original</a>

<p>A “container” is just a term people use to describe a combination of Linux namespaces and cgroups.
Containers were not a top level design, they are something we build from Linux primitives. 
Zones, Jails, and VMs are designed as top level isolation.
Jails, Zones, VMs and containers were designed and built in different ways. Containers are not a 
Linux isolation primitive, they merely consume Linux primitives which allow for some interesting interactions.</p>

<b>Throttle tha bandiwdth on a Linux interface</b>
<a href="https://mark.koli.ch/slowdown-throttle-bandwidth-linux-network-interface">Original</a>

<p>
In complex service oriented application stacks, some bugs only manifest themselves on congested or slow networking interfaces. 
Most Linux distros ship with the tc command which is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel.

Add 500ms latency to all network traffic:
<pre>
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 500ms
</pre>

The connection may start slow — as shaped by our tc delay tweak — but once things are 
started TCP will ramp up and eventually hit full speed again.

To permanently throttle an interface:

<pre>
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle 1: root htb default 11
sudo tc class add dev eth0 parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 1kbps
sudo tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:1 classid 1:11 htb rate 1kbps
</pre>

Finally, rules can be cleared with: <pre>sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root</pre>
</p>

<b>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Google</b>

<p>
In general, an SRE team is responsible for availability, 
latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning.

To SRE, software engineers are people who know enough about programming languages, data structures and algorithms, 
and performance to be able to write software that is effective.

Typically, we hire about a 50-50 mix of people who have more of a 
software background and people who have more of a systems background.

We care deeply about keeping SRE an engineering function, 
so our rule of thumb is that an SRE team must spend at least 50% of its time doing development.

<b>Firewall: nftables</b>
<a href="http://ral-arturo.org/2017/05/05/debian-stretch-stable-nftables.html">Original</a>

<p>
Released by the Netfilter project.
nftables is meant to replace iptables (also ip6tables, arptables and ebtables).
It comes with a new command line utility nft whose syntax is different to iptables.
It also comes with a compatibility layer that allows you to run iptables commands over the new nftables kernel framework.
It provides generic set infrastructure that allows you to construct maps and concatenation. 
You can use this new feature to arrange your ruleset in multidimensional tree which drastically 
reduces the number of rules that need to be inspected until you find the final action on the packet.
