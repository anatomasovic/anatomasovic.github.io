<b>Linux audio - ALSA and OSS</b>

<p>Linux has two sets of audio devices. There are separate devices for the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) system interface and the older
Open Sound System (OSS). The ALSA devices are in the /dev/snd directory,
but it’s difficult to work with them directly. Linux systems that use ALSA
support OSS backward-compatible devices if the OSS kernel support is currently loaded.
Some rudimentary operations are possible with the OSS dsp and audio
devices. For example, the computer plays any WAV file that you send to
/dev/dsp. However, the hardware may not do what you expect due to fre-
quency mismatches. Furthermore, on most systems, the device is often busy
as soon as you log in.</p>

<br>

<b>C++ and Linux kernel</b>
<p>Linux kernel developers see C++ as a combination of worst aspects of C and higher-level languages.</p>
<p>But, sometimes, C++ support is needed.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is that some developers might actually want to write programs in C++ that need 
  access to the kernel's API; there is no accounting for taste, after all. 
  For most system calls, the details of the real kernel API (as opposed to the POSIX-like API exposed by the C library) 
  tend to be hidden, but there are exceptions; the most widespread of those is almost certainly the ioctl() system call. 
  There is a large set of structures used with ioctl(); their definition is a big part of the kernel's UAPI. 
  If a C++ compiler cannot compile those UAPI definitions, then those ioctl() calls cannot be invoked from C++.</p>

<br>

<b>Verifying Linux kernel patches with AI</b>
<p>Use machine learning to distinguish patches that fix bugs from others.</p>
<p>When a developer fixes a bug in a patch they can add a "stable tag" to the commit or send a mail 
  to the stable mailing list; Greg Kroah-Hartman will then pick up the fix, evaluate it, and add it 
  to the stable tree. But that means that the stable tree is only getting the fixes that are pointed 
  out to the stable maintainers.</p>
<p>Patch authors are unsure whether something can be marked as stable.</p>
<p>Different subsystems have different rules for submitting stable patches.</p>
<p>To automate things, you need to figure out what makes a patch stable/bug fix.</p>
<p>[...] He then trained the neural network with commits from Linux 3.0 to 4.16, where the "true" value was whether the commit was in the stable tree.</p>
<p>The resulting neural network is called PatchNet.</p>

<b>Containers, zones, jails, VMs</b>
<a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/">Original</a>

<p>A “container” is just a term people use to describe a combination of Linux namespaces and cgroups.
Containers were not a top level design, they are something we build from Linux primitives. 
Zones, Jails, and VMs are designed as top level isolation.
Jails, Zones, VMs and containers were designed and built in different ways. Containers are not a 
Linux isolation primitive, they merely consume Linux primitives which allow for some interesting interactions.</p>

<b>Throttle the bandiwdth on a Linux interface</b>
<a href="https://mark.koli.ch/slowdown-throttle-bandwidth-linux-network-interface">Original</a>

<p>
In complex service oriented application stacks, some bugs only manifest themselves on congested or slow networking interfaces. 
Most Linux distros ship with the tc command which is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel.

Add 500ms latency to all network traffic:
<pre>
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 500ms
</pre>

The connection may start slow — as shaped by our tc delay tweak — but once things are 
started TCP will ramp up and eventually hit full speed again.

To permanently throttle an interface:

<pre>
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle 1: root htb default 11
sudo tc class add dev eth0 parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 1kbps
sudo tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:1 classid 1:11 htb rate 1kbps
</pre>

Finally, rules can be cleared with: <pre>sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root</pre>
</p>

<b>Firewall: nftables</b>
<a href="http://ral-arturo.org/2017/05/05/debian-stretch-stable-nftables.html">Original</a>

<p>
Released by the Netfilter project.
nftables is meant to replace iptables (also ip6tables, arptables and ebtables).
It comes with a new command line utility nft whose syntax is different to iptables.
It also comes with a compatibility layer that allows you to run iptables commands over the new nftables kernel framework.
It provides generic set infrastructure that allows you to construct maps and concatenation. 
You can use this new feature to arrange your ruleset in multidimensional tree which drastically 
reduces the number of rules that need to be inspected until you find the final action on the packet.

<b>Why does man print "gimme gimme gimme" at 00:30?</b>
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405783/why-does-man-print-gimme-gimme-gimme-at-0030">Original</a>
<p>Pretty much the whole story is in the commit. The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, 
    and one day six years ago I jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it 
    should print "gimme gimme gimme", because of the Abba song called "Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight"</p>
    <p>Running man with -w will not do this.</p>

<b>Deprecating older Linux tools</b>
<a href="https://twitter.com/voretaq7/status/976223721475239937">Original</a>
<p>
  So add a new tool if you absolutely must, but don’t break LITERALLY 50 YEARS of accumulated practice, 
  knowledge, and tools. If I have a broken machine I need to be able to use my muscle memory to quickly 
  troubleshoot, not spend 10 minutes googling what new command I have to use.
</p>
<p>
  "Works fine (if you go figure out what package you need to install, in the middle of a production outage, 
  because the tool you would use on literally any other unix-like system to troubleshoot doesn't exist here)."
